# 1. VISION & IDENTITY OF **SCINE**

**SCINE is a psychological, adaptive, procedurally generated RPG where the world is not a place you explore — it is a mirror that explores you.**

Everything in SCINE follows four central truths:

1. **The world reacts to who you are, not what you select from menus.**  
2. **Your actions create echoes — consequences that return later when you don’t expect them.**  
3. **NPCs understand, adapt, and shift tone based on your psyche.**  
4. **You are trapped in a loop of yourself — and the only escape is change.**

SCINE merges:

- narrative design  
- psychological profiling  
- AI NPC systems  
- procedural world generation  
- subtle moral choice & consequence  

to create a game that cannot be played the same way twice — even by the same person.

# 2. CORE NARRATIVE PILLARS

1. **The World as the Self**  
   Environments, events, NPC behavior all reflect the player’s personality.

2. **The Loop**  
   SCINE simulates repeating behavioral patterns.  
   The loop breaks only when the player *changes* their approach.

3. **Consequences Delayed, Not Immediate**  
   Moral echoes return later under fitting narrative conditions.

4. **Guidance Through Reflection, Not Instruction**  
   The mentor questions, nudges, observes — never commands.

5. **Dreams and Visions as Meta‑Hints**  
   Subtle reminders of the world’s nature when the player is stuck in their own destructive pattern.

---

# 3. META‑STRUCTURE & PLAYER ROLE

**Player Identity:**  
A contemporary human invited to test the *NEUROSIM Cognitive Simulation Engine*.

**Institution:**  
A secretive research entity interested in mapping human decision‑making.

**Simulation Truth:**  
Never fully explained.  
Revealed only through emergent understanding.

The player is not *playing a character*.  
The player **is themselves** — stripped into a symbolic world that exposes their behavioral core.

---

# 4. WORLD FRAMEWORK & AESTHETIC ERAS

SCINE uses a *single mechanical era* but multiple aesthetic skins:

- **1980s retro suburbia**
- **1990s neon‑noir city district**
- **2000s small town**
- **2020s modern metropolitan zone**
- **Near‑future sterile districts**

Mechanically identical.  
Emotionally different.

**Test result + player’s self‑chosen preference = Starting index.**

The world shifts subtly between eras as the psyche loop evolves.

---

# 5. PSYCHOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE & ARCHETYPES

Your in‑simulation persona is determined by the **AI‑assessed psychological test**.

### Archetypes (initial shortlist)
- **Protector** (empathy, loyalty, self‑sacrifice)  
- **Manipulator** (strategic, low empathy, goal‑driven)  
- **Nomad** (freedom‑seeking, detached)  
- **Strategist** (logic‑focused, stability seeking)  
- **Enthusiast** (chaotic, creative, impulsive)  
- **Arbiter** (justice, order, rules)

Archetype determines:

- starting area  
- NPC trust levels  
- difficulty curve  
- pacing of events  
- tone of world commentary  

---

# 6. MENTOR SYSTEM — DYNAMIC ADAPTIVE COMPANION

The mentor is:

- your stabilizing force  
- your mirror  
- your subconscious refusing to admit it  
- your only constant  

### Key Mechanisms:

**Visual Adaptation:**  
Mentor’s style, clothing, age shift depending on era.

**Personality Adaptation:**  
Warm, cold, sarcastic, cautious — depending on your behavioral patterns.

**Memory Offset:**  
Mentor never notices world changes.  
Always says:  
“It's always been like this.”

**Current Theoretical Form:**  
A person leaning over you when you first awaken — face extremely close.

---

# 7. WORLD STRUCTURE — KALEIDOSCOPIC REALITY

The world only exists:

- within a radius around the player  
- in memory fragments kept active  
- recolored and reshaped to fit the psyche loop  

When leaving an area too far:

- the world reconstructs  
- returning will not recreate what was  
- NPCs deny changes  

This preserves:

- optimization  
- narrative surrealism  
- immersion in psychological distortion  

---

# 8. NPC ARCHITECTURE — ECHO / CORE / HOST AI

### 1. **Core NPCs**
Narrative characters (5–7 per major loop).

### 2. **Echo NPCs**
Background population with minimal interactivity.

### 3. **Host NPCs**  
Dynamic AI‑possessed characters.

When player interacts with a random NPC, the system picks a “host” and seamlessly transitions them into a meaningful interaction.

The illusion:  
**Anyone may matter.**

---

# 9. MORAL ECHO ENGINE (MEE)

The core mechanic behind SCINE.

### Actions are tagged:
- Betrayal  
- Mercy  
- Manipulation  
- Cowardice  
- Loyalty  
- Violence  
- Avoidance  
- Sacrifice  

### Consequences:
Appear **later**, under psychologically fitting conditions.

The world “waits” until:

- a similar context arises  
- a symbolic moment emerges  
- the loop has tightened enough  

This makes the game feel alive, intelligent and deeply reflective.

---

# 10. TRANSITION SYSTEM BETWEEN WORLDS

Hybrid system:

- Small changes → seamless  
- Major emotional/era shifts → short symbolic cut‑ins  
- Dreams → guidance when stuck  
- Visions → subtle warnings about destructive patterns  

The world changes tone, not geography.

---

# 11. CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP

1. Wake in a world that reflects you.  
2. Explore, meet NPCs, perform tasks.  
3. Build a dynamic relationship with the mentor.  
4. Face moral choices (explicit or emergent).  
5. Trigger moral echoes.  
6. Observe world shift.  
7. Break or fail to break the loop.  
8. Move into the next psychological phase.

---

# 12. CHARACTER CREATOR & AI‑DRIVEN LOOK GENERATION

Options:

- manual detailed slider system  
- text prompt to AI for auto‑generation  
- hybrid (AI generates 3–4 variations you refine)

---

# 13. FULL PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST DESIGN

## Structure:
1. **Friendly rapport building**  
2. **Clinical evaluation (scaled questions)**  
3. **Moral scenario simulations**  
4. **Open questions processed by LLM**

AI extracts:

- behavioral tendencies  
- moral alignment  
- emotional tone  
- cognitive style  
- conflict approach  
- empathy levels  

Result → archetype → starting zone.

---

# 14. OPENING SEQUENCE & FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH MENTOR

Sequence:

1. POV inside the capsule  
2. Heavy eyelids → 1st blink: lab  
3. 2nd blink: world dissolving  
4. 3rd blink: open eyes fully →

**Mentor’s face at 10 cm**  

Dialogue (bubble-based):  
“You weren’t breathing. Looked dead. Strange though…  
Passed here minutes ago. Nothing here then.”

Player is invited to follow the mentor to a safe space → tutorial.

---

# 15. QUEST GENERATION LOGIC

- **Primary quests** created from archetype + world tone  
- **Secondary quests** built from player behavior tags  
- **Emergent quests** triggered by moral echoes  
- **Conversational quests** created dynamically based on NPC relationships  

Questlines shift as the psyche loop evolves.

---

# 16. MEMORY, DREAMS & VISION MECHANICS

Dreams appear when:

- player fails to break a harmful loop  
- moral echoes accumulate without release  
- player hits stagnation  

Visions:

- brief surreal flashes foreshadowing world changes  
- warnings about tendencies (not instructions)

---

# 17. STRUCTURAL RULES FOR AI SAFETY & NARRATIVE COHERENCE

- AI NPCs operate within strict personas.  
- They cannot discuss meta-simulation.  
- They cannot break tone of current era.  
- They cannot reference “previous loops” directly.  
- Their memory is *local and contextual*.  
- Host NPCs despawn cleanly after interaction.
